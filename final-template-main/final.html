			<h3>Green ... and Growing</h3>

			<p>Recent data from New York State shows that solar development is on the rise. According to numbers of new solar development contracts released by the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Solar-Electric-Programs-Reported-by-NYSERDA-Beginn/3x8r-34rs/about_data">New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA)</a>, there was a sharp increase in 2022. The jump, 44% higher than the previous year, kept pace in the following years, with the rate of development growing slowly.</p>

			<p>This trend isn’t isolated to New York State. According to the <a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Project/Nyserda/Files/Programs/Clean-Energy-Standard/A00194900000C313A126877CFFAA2B0C.pdf">Clean Energy Standard (CES) Biennial Review</a> published by the state’s Department of Public Service in July of this year, utility-scale solar installations nationwide increased by 77% between 2022 and 2023.</p>

			<p>They attribute this sharp jump to various factors. One key reason was that 2023 was “a year of recovery for the solar industry” due to widespread supply chain disruptions in the previous years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those disruptions caused new installations that would have otherwise taken place then to happen later, though the rate has slowed since as many of the projects have since been completed.</p>

			<p>Additionally, the report attributed that increase to federal support. Much of it came from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2022. The law provided tax credits for homeowners to promote energy efficiency and solar adoption, and it also provided incentives for companies to develop supply chains in renewable-related manufacturing domestically.</p>

			<p>However, it may be too early to tell just how much impact the IRA will have. That is according to Kevin Nickels, the vice president of a residential solar developer in Syracuse, NY. He says that we can’t attribute much of the law’s impact to the growth in development for larger projects in 2022 and 2023 because of their long development times, meaning that the benefits “will be seen years from now.”

			<h3>“It’s a lofty goal…”</h3>
			<p>The scale of New York’s renewable energy expansion will ultimately be judged in the context of the state’s energy goals. Such goals were outlined in the <a href="https://climate.ny.gov/our-impact/our-progress/">Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA)</a> passed in 2019, which marks the target of the state producing 70% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, with the additional goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.</p>

			<p>The CES biennial report has found these goals to be “extraordinarily ambitious.” It also asserts that the state has undergone “an unprecedented mobilization of procurement, permitting reform, workforce development, and complementary actions” to meet them.</p>

			<p>However, New York may still fall short of meeting these goals. Marguerite Wells, the executive director of the green energy advocacy group <a href="https://www.aceny.org/">ACE NY</a>, doesn’t think we can meet them at our current rate.</p>

			<p>“If you look at just the number of projects that have been brought online in the last couple of years,” she said, “it looks like we’re not making great progress.”</p>

			<p>This claim isn’t unfounded. According to the July CES Biennial Review, current projections show that the goal of 70% renewable will not be reached until the year 2033.</p>

			<p>Not everyone is dissuaded. Nickels stated that he still embraces the CLCPA’s ambitiousness. “It's a lofty goal and I think it's good to set goals,” he said, “even if the reality might be that we come up short.”</p>

			<h3>“Poised to change…”</h3>
			<p>But in spite of the disappointing outlook, Wells believes that we shouldn’t discount the idea that the future will bode well for the state’s goals. “I'm pretty optimistic actually that although the numbers don't look great from where we sit today in terms of where we are proceeding towards state targets,” she said, “I think that's poised to change pretty well going forward.”</p>


			<p>Wells credits this to the various reforms taking place in the state over the years to drive up green energy adoption in recent years. The most recent of which is the RAPID Act, which was signed into law in April of 2024. It streamlined the process for issuing permits to large projects for development by concentrating the tasks across the various stages of permitting into one single nexus, the Office of Renewable Energy Siting and Electric Transmission (ORES). </p>
			
			<p>Prior to this reform, large projects had to be permitted through the process known as “Article 10” under the Department of Public Service. According to the CES report, the time it took between filing for a permit and the permit being issued averaged at 3.5 years. Now they have taken on average 1.2 years, with some applications being obligated to be completed within 6 months, depending on the site’s location.</p>

			<p>Another reform is in grid connections. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a ruling, known as <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/explainer-interconnection-final-rule">“Order 2023,”</a> to state energy regulators such as the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). It requires them to streamline the process for integrating new projects into the grid through various means. One key change was to require that all feasibility and impact studies be integrated into sets of “cluster studies” rather than being done separately.</p>

			<p>According to the CES report, this would standardize the time frame for conducting interconnection studies and speed up development times, cutting costs. However, they state that it will take years until the impacts of this change are fully realized.</p>
			<iframe title="Announced Investments into Large Clean Energy Projects Nationwide after Passage of IRA" aria-label="Stacked Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-hoiHB" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hoiHB/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="589" data-external="1"></iframe>


			<p>Wells finds renewed hope in light of these reforms. “I think we will soon see projects getting built quicker than they had,” she said. “It's not visible yet because it takes a while for the reformed processes to then start kicking projects out at a faster rate, but I think we're gonna see that.”</p>

			<p>The same can be said about renewable energy manufacturing. According to data from <a href="https://e2.org/announcements/">E2</a>, a pro-environmental organization of business leaders, private companies have announced investments of over $100 billion in manufacturing nationwide after the passage of the IRA, with $574 million going towards New York in particular.</p>


			<p>The impact of this wave of manufacturing still has yet to be seen because, as the CES report states, the emerging supply chains to be used in supporting existing renewable energy project development “will likely take several years” to build up.</p> 
			
			<p>Nickels sees potential in the emerging industry. “Some states are just kind of waking up and realize what a great opportunity it is for manufacturing, for good-paying jobs,” he said. “I'm very curious to see what happens.”</p>

			<p>To Wells, it is unclear whether or not these desired changes will be enough to surpass New York’s CLCPA goals, but she maintains that the state is an enduring example to follow. “None of us know what's coming or what exactly is going to shake out,” she said. “But being here in the state of New York, we're in a place that's committed to fighting climate change and building equity for all New Yorkers and committed to economic development.”
